## Project Organization

We recommend creating a folder called 'arc' where all your projects will live.  When you launch your VM, there will be two directories mapped to your host machine:

`/current/` will map to the directory where this project lives
`/parent/` will map to the directory above where this project lives


#### Starting Vagrant ####

From within the `ui-devtools` directory, issue `vagrant up` and the development VM will start. The first time, it can take up to 30 minutes, as it will be copying disk images and installing software.

#####Vagrant Commands:#####

- `vagrant ssh` - used to log into the VM
- `vagrant halt` - shutdown the VM
- `vagrant destroy` - shutdown the VM and erase all installed software.
