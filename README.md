# ARC UI DevTools

The ARC UI project repository is in Git (Stash), so you must have access to http://stash.mtvi.com/ARC/ in order to check out code.
(But you probably know that already cause you are here).

If you need access to http://stash.mtvi.com/ but in a request to the DSS Jira queue.


## Prerequisites

## Project Organization

We recommend creating a folder called 'arc' where all your projects will live.  When you launch your VM, there will be two directories mapped to your host machine:

`/current/` will map to the directory where this project lives
`/parent/` will map to the parent directory to where this project lives


## Starting Vagrant

From within the `ui-devtools` directory, issue `vagrant up` and the development VM will start. The first time, it can take up to 30 minutes, as it will be copying disk images and installing software.


## Vagrant Commands

- `vagrant ssh` - used to log into the VM
- `vagrant halt` - shutdown the VM
- `vagrant destroy` - shutdown the VM and erase all installed software.


## Git Commands

- `git status` - show what branch you are on and what changes are tracked
- `git commit -m "commit message" filename` - commit file changes to local staging
- `git push origin dev` - push changes to dev branch from local staging to Stash remote repository 
- `git pull origin dev` - pull changes to dev branch from Stash remote repository into your local repository


## NPM Commands

- `npm install` - fetch and intall dependencies that are configured in package.json

## Port Forwarding

- 3000 -> 8081 web server
- 9876 -> 9876 Karma test runner and results


## Included Software

- nodejs/npm
- phantomjs
- curl
